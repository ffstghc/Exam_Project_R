My solution to our exam project in R for the "Introduction to Programming in Python and R for Biosciences" course.
It was graded "passed with distinction" (the highest possible grade).

The tasks are described in "Instructions.png" and consisted mainly of data management, calculations and visualization.

The lecturer's feedback:
Very good job!
Your script implements all required tasks, runs well, uses packages, avoids redundancies and shows a good understanding of R and Rmd.
